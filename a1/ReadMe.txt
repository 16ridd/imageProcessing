TA comments: 

I'm not sure if I completed the brightness and contrast modifications as expected but I believe 
that I went about it the same way as demonstraced in class.

Additionally, I was not able to figure out how to complete local histogram equalization on edge cases.
I attempted to complete it using a hard coded method but it was unsuccessful.  I left it in the program but commented it out.

Finally, after attempting to solve part 3 in multiple way I have given up and commented out my code so that the program will run.
